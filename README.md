# Election_Map


This program is going to be used to determine which combinations of states are required for a presidential candidate to win an election using the Electoral College system. The input is a text file that labels which states have already been won by each candidate, and which are left. The program uses the information from the text file to determine how many different combinations of remaining states exist for each candidate to win, along with other statistics and information based on the information given.
